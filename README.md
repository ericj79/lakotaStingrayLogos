# Lakota Stingrays Swimming Logos
Set of vector logos for the Lakota YMCA swim team. Vector images are infinitely scalable, so they won't get pixelated if you try to enlarge them. These images are all in teh Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) format. These images should be viewable in all modern web browsers. For editing, you can use a program such as [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html), if you have a license for it. I use [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/) for editing the images, because I don't do this type of work enough to merit purchasing an Adobe license.

## FYI 
None of these logos were originated by me. I have just converted them to vector formats for people to use. I claim no rights to these images. I also do not claim any expertise in graphic design. I simply have some understanding of how vector based images, due to my work as a software developer.
